# Economic-Dispatch-Problem-using-Genetic-Algorithm
I solved the Economic Dispatch problem considering generators using the Gradient Method and Genetic Algorithm. Implementation was done on MATLAB. The problem consisted of 2 cases: <br/>
I. Three Thermal Generators <br/>
II. Two Thermal Generators + 1 Wind Farm <br/>
I used the Hetzer Model for the implementation of Wind Farm. You may take a look at the attached report.
